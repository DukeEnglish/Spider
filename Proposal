# Proposal

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to explore the function of a framework: scrapy and use it to fetch useful information from Internet.

## Introduction
Scrapy is an application framework for crawling web sites and extracting structured data which can be used for a wide range of useful applications, like data mining, information processing or historical archival.

Even though Scrapy was originally designed for web scraping, it can also be used to extract data using APIs (such as Amazon Associates Web Services) or as a general purpose web crawler. (copu from https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/overview.html)

## Proposed Program
For this project, we have three target website for now:

- 豆瓣
- 汽车之家
- 百度百科

After these, we may need to do similar things to 旅游，汽车，教育，百度知道，知乎等进行尝试。
