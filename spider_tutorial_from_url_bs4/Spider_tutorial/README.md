This is a basic tutorial of spider. All you need is a jupyter notebook, python2.7 (or python3 if you know the difference between them).

Besides, if you want to run all the code, you may need to install beautifulsoup4, requests, lxml. 

Scrapy is a strong framework but if you just want to do some basic work, I do not think you need it. Of course, if you need it, I assume you want to learn this systemically, so please start from the tutorial 1.
